# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market moore effectively , this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills , streamlining others work to find optimal jobs .
Data hails from [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job-titles , salaries , locations, essential skills.

### The Questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the 10 top paying data analyst jobs available remotely and also the company names of those job roles?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying data analyst jobs?
3.  What are the most in demand skills for data analysts?
4.  What are top skills based on salary/ top paying skills for data analysts?
5.  What are the most optimal skills to learn (high deamnd and high paying)

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis , allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights .
- **PostgresSQL:** The chosen database management system , ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & Github :** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approached each question:
### 1. Top paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles , I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location , focusing on remote jobs.This query highlights the high-paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT  job_id,
        job_title,
        job_location,
        job_schedule_type,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        name AS company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON
job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short= 'Data Analyst' 
        AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere'
      AND
      salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.

LEFT JOIN company_dim ON
job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short= 'Data Analyst' 
        AND
      job_location = 'Anywhere'
      AND
      salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT top_paying_jobs.*,
        skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON
top_paying_jobs.job_id= skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON 
skills_job_dim.skill_id= skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
```
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the top-paying skills for data analyst roles:

-**High-paying technical tools:** Skills like Jupyter ($154,238), PySpark ($143,616), and Databricks ($142,768) lead the list, highlighting strong demand for data engineering and big data tools.
